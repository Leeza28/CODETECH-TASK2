## Overview of the Project 

## Project: MODEL EVALUATION AND COMPARISION


## Objective
The objective of this task is to Evaluate the performance of AI models is crucial for determining their effectiveness in solving a particular problem. This task involves implementing and comparing different AI models using appropriate evaluation metrics.


## Key Activities 
**Data Collection:** Ensuring that data is collected from various source and reliable source for good model traning.
**Important Libraries:** Import important libraries for data processing 
**Data Cleaning:** Ensuring that data is free from inconsistencies and missing values.
**Data Visualization:** Creating visualizations to understand data distributions, trends, and relationships.
**Different model implementation:** Applying different model on the same dataset.
**Model Comparision:** Comparing different models with the help of accuracy score.
 

## Technologies Used 
**Python:** The primary programming language for data processing, providing the foundation for writing and executing code.

**pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis, allowing you to handle data structures like DataFrames and Series for cleaning, transforming, and summarizing data.

**numpy:** Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It's often used for numerical computations and array manipulations.

**matplotlib:** A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is useful for generating various types of plots and charts to visualize data.

**sklearn (scikit-learn):** A machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It includes algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction, as well as utilities for model selection and evaluation.
